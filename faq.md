# 1. What is 'Emotimemo'?
Emotimemo is an emotion-tagged anonymous memo to someone. Sometimes you have emotions that are difficult to tell someone. Emotimemo helps you send these on your behalf.

In Emotimemo, user uses a nickname which is randomly generated, not unique. The nickname can not be changed once created.

# 3. What is 'News Feed'?
In 'News Feed', users can see the latest public emotimemos of contacts they subscribe to.

# 4. How can to subscribe to contacts?
By writing a memo for the first time to a contact, you can subscribe to it.
'Subscribing' button will appear in 'Contact Details'.
The first time you sign in to the app, you subscribe to your e-mail account automatically. So you can see the public memos written to you in the ‘News Feed’. 

# 5. How can I unsubscribe to contacts?
 In 'Contact Details', touch the "Subscribing" button. The subscription will be canceled and the button will be changed to "Subscribe" .

# 6. Memos
- Every memo is anonymous.
- User can create a public or private memos. The default is public.
- When a user create a public memo, the memo will be visible to other users. A notification(e-mail or push) will be sent to the contact. In notification mail, the sender is displayed as 'Emotimemo'.
- Public memos can be switched to the private later.
- Private memos are visible only to you. No notification is sent. You can switch it to public later.
- You must not create memos that are containing personal information, advertising, obscene, violent content. When found, you can report these via the 'Report' function.
- The reported memos can be blocked, and the user account can be blocked too.
- User can write up to 200 characters and add up to 3 emotion tags in a memo.

# 7 About security and privacy
- Emotimemo provides the highest level of security and privacy.
- Emotimemo does not require any personal information except e-mail account.
- The contacts used in memos will be encrypted to the highest level.
- Emotimemo app uses the contact information from the phone to display.
Therefore, if you delete a contact from the phone, you can not see the contact information in the app. The already-written memos appear as ‘Not In Contacts'.
- The advantage of this approach, even if someone has stolen your account, he can't know the contact information from the memos.
- The disadvantage of this approach is if you delete a contact from the phone, you may not know whether you wrote to whom.
- Adding back a deleted contact, you can view the contact information on the memo again.
